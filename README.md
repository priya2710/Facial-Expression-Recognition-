# Facial-Expression-Recognition-
This project is based on the LeNet architecture with slight modification in the pooling part. We can recognize the facial expression of human faces into seven categories: Angry, Happy, Sad, Neutral, Disgust etc. This model will be further deployed using flask on Heroku. It was the minor project of college.
